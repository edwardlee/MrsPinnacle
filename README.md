I have extracted this from the open-source Extension Boilerplate project, [Email This](https://www.emailthis.me).

> Side note: Do check out [**Email This**](https://www.emailthis.me). It is a simpler alternative to bookmarking tools like Pocket, Readability & Instapaper. Email This will remove ads & distractions from an article and send you a nice email with just the text/images. No need to install any additional applications or login to another app just to access your bookmarks. 
The Chrome Extensions is available [on the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/email-this/lgblkllcjgihfnlefhnnpppndbbjallh).

In creating this project, open source code was taken from:

-https://github.com/EmailThis/extension-boilerplate for the icons, options.js, contentscript.js, popup.js and background.js in scripts, styles, options.html, README.md, LICENSE.txt, and .gitignore.txt.

-https://canvasjs.com/html5-javascript-bar-chart/ for chart.js in scripts and popup.html.

-https://canvasjs.com for canvasjs.min.js and jquery-3.5.1.min.js in scripts.

-https://stackoverflow.com for functions in the files attempt1_content.js, attempt1_content_simple.js, attempt1_background.js, and attempt1_background_simple.js in the scripts folder. The particular code used is documented within the comments.

-https://thoughtbot.com for functions in attempt1_background.js in the scripts folder, again with the specifics in the comments.

Again, more details are in the comments within the files.
